title: What is Tarlab?
---
Tarlab is a hackerspace (or 'hacklab' which is better suited for Finnish language) in Oulu, Finland. We have space available for tinkering, building and repairing things, and crafts.

Tarlab is a non-profit assosciation open to join by everyone. We are funded by our members and organize different events as part of our operations.
Tarlab is part of [Hacklab.fi](https://hacklab.fi)-network. More info about hackerspaces can be found from [Hackerspaces.org](https://hackerspaces.org/).

You can come and check out our space during open night organized every Tuesday at 20:00 (please still check that we are open before coming). 
Our lab is located in Tuira, [Valtatie 67](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=65.02556&mlon=25.48520#map=18/65.02556/25.48520){:target="_blank"}.
